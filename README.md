# Playground
The Playground repository is a collection of small projects and experiments, showcasing foundational programming concepts and practical implementations in C. It includes a variety of exercises, tools, and games, designed to improve coding skills and explore algorithmic problem-solving.

# Features
- *Tic-Tac-Toe Game*: A 2-player grid-based game that demonstrates 2D array manipulation, input validation, and error handling. Future Enhancements:
Implement win-checking logic to determine if a player has won.
Add a replay option to restart the game.
  
- *Utility Programs* : Functions and tools for string manipulation, file handling, and mathematical operations.
- *Algorithmic Exploration*: Practice with sorting, searching, and data structure manipulation.
